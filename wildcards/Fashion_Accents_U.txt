All flash and no dash
Beauty blight
Bedraggled
Blowzy over-done
Boots with newspaper stuffed inside to cover the holes in the soles
Clothes painted on
Donned grubbies for yard work
Dress gone limp in the heat
Dressed like an unmade bed
Dressed like fleeing a fire
Dressed like fleeing the devil
Ensemble clashes
Flamboyant colors clashed
Gaudy
gauche
High water pants
flood pants
House dress that looks like a slipcover
Huge hat with a hectic array of stuff
Jeans deliberately torn and frayed
Misshapen straw hat perched at a jaunty angle
Motley hat tilted over one eye
Nondescript
Off-beat
kinky
Bohemian
hippie
beatnick
Patched hand-me-downs
Scandalous
Shows more of self than does style
Tattered cast-offs
Teen uniform: jeans, scruffy T-shirt, dirty sneakers and no socks
Threadbare
napless
frayed
holey
dilapidated
misshapen
Wretched condition
