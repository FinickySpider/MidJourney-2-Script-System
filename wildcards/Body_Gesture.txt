hung head
ducked
bowed head
covered eyes with a hand
pressed hands to cheeks
raised chin
lifted chin
hands tightened into fists
arms remained at  sides
shrugged
gave a half shrug
gave a dismissive wave of hand
raised a hand in greeting
waved
held up hands
lifted hands
held up palms
threw hands in the air
brushed palms together
rubbed hands together
made a steeple of fingers
spread hands
gesticulated
waved hands
clapped hands
snapped fingers
held up a finger
pointed
gestured with a thumb
gave the finger
gave the thumbs up
put hands on hips
shoved hands in pockets
jammed hands in front pockets
rested a hand on hip
jutted out hip
folded arms
crossed arms over  chest
hugged self
wrapped arms around hself
rocked back and forth
spread arms wide
held out arms
held out hand
extended a hand
shook head
nodded
bobbed head
tilted head
cocked head
inclined head
beckoning
finger heart
ily sign
loser gesture
talk to the hand
air quotes
awkward turle gesture
eye-rolling
air kiss
blow kiss
making duck face
making fish lips
blowing raspberry
facepalm
making puppy face
making puppy dog eyes
shrug
thumbing the nose
making woe is me gesture
Twirling hair
running fingers through hair
rest hands on hips
folded arms
tilted head
cocked head
turn face away
play with hair
twirl hair
