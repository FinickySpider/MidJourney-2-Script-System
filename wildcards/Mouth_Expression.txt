smiling
smirking
grinning
simpering
beaming
mouth curved into a smile
corners of mouth turned up
corner of mouth quirked up
a corner of mouth lifted
half-smile
lopsided grin
mouth twisted
smile plastered on face
forced a smile
faked a smile
smile faded
smile slipped
pursed lips
pouting lips
mouth snapped shut
mouth set in hard line
Lips pressed together
biting lip
lower lip drawn between teeth
nibble bottom lip
chew on bottom lip
jaw set
jaw clenched
jaw tightened
grinding jaw
snarled lips
Lips drawn back in a snarl
mouth fell open
jaw dropped
jaw went slack
gritted teeth
lower lip trembled
lower lip quivered
biting bottom lip
sexy smile
warm smile
