screwed up face
scrunched up face
face grimaced
face winced
gave a dirty look
face frowned
face scowled
face glowered
whole face lit up
face brightened
face went blank
face contorted
face twisted
expression closed up
expression dulled
expression hardened
poker-faced
vein popping out of neck
fear crossed face
sadness clouded features
terror overtook face
recognition dawned on face
nose crinkled
nose wrinkled
nostrils flared
blushing
